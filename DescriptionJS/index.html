(from English HyperText Markup Language - "language of hypertext markup") is a standardized markup language for documents on the World Wide Web. Most web pages contain a description of markup in HTML (or XHTML). The HTML language is interpreted by browsers; The resulting formatted text is displayed on the monitor of a computer or mobile device.</p>

<p>The HTML language prior to the 5th version was defined as an SGML application (the standard generic markup language according to ISO 8879). The HTML5 specifications are formulated in terms of the DOM (document object model).</p>

<p>
The XHTML language is a more stringent version of HTML, it follows the XML syntax and is an XML application in the hypertext markup area.</p>

<p>In the World Wide Web, HTML pages are usually transmitted to browsers from the server via HTTP or HTTPS protocols, as plain text or using encryption.</p></article></section>

The HTML language was developed by the British scientist Tim Berners-Lee around 1986-1991 in the walls of CERN in Geneva in Switzerland. HTML was created as a language for the exchange of scientific and technical documentation, suitable for use by people who are not specialists in layout. HTML successfully coped with the problem of the complexity of SGML by defining a small set of structural and semantic elements - descriptors. Descriptors are also often called "tags". With HTML, you can easily create a relatively simple, but beautifully designed document. In addition to simplifying the structure of the document, HTML supports hypertext. Multimedia features were added later.</p>

<p>
Initially, the HTML language was conceived and created as a means of structuring and formatting documents without their binding to the means of playback (display). Ideally, the text with HTML markup should be reproduced on hardware with different technical equipment (color screen of a modern computer, monochrome screen of the organizer, a limited screen of a mobile phone or devices and programs for voice playback of texts) without stylistic and structural distortions.
However, the modern application of HTML is very far from its original task. For example, the "table" tag is intended to create tables in documents, but is sometimes used to arrange the placement of elements on the page. Over time, the basic idea of ​​the platform independence of the HTML language was sacrificed to modern needs in multimedia and graphic design.</p></article>

Text documents containing HTML markup (such documents traditionally have the extension .html or .htm) are processed by special applications that display the document in its formatted form. Such applications, called "browsers" or "Internet browsers", usually provide the user with a convenient interface for requesting web pages, viewing them (and outputting them to other external devices) and, if necessary, sending user-entered data to the server. The most popular browsers today are Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, Internet Explorer and Safari.</p></article>

      <p> 
There is no official HTML 1.0 specification. Until 1995 there were many unofficial HTML standards. In order for the standard version to differ from them, they immediately assigned the second number</p>
        <p> 
Version 3 was offered by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in March 1995 and provided many new features, such as creating tables, "wrapping" images with text and displaying complex mathematical formulas, supporting the gif format. Even though this standard was compatible with the second version, its implementation was difficult for the browsers of that time. Version 3.1 was never officially proposed, and the next version of the HTML standard was 3.2, which omitted many innovations from version 3.0, but added non-standard elements supported by the Netscape Navigator and Mosaic browsers.</p>
          <p> 

In the version of HTML 4.0, there was some "cleaning" of the standard. Many elements were marked as outdated and not recommended (English deprecated). In particular, the font tag used to change the font properties was marked as obsolete (CSS stylesheets are recommended instead).</p>
            <p> 

In 1998, the World Wide Web Consortium began work on a new markup language based on HTML 4, but with the appropriate XML syntax. Subsequently, the new language was called XHTML. The first version of XHTML 1.0 was approved as a Recommendation of the World Wide Web Consortium on January 26, 2000.</p>
              <p> 

The planned version of XHTML 2.0 was supposed to break compatibility with older versions of HTML and XHTML, but on July 2, 2009, the World Wide Web Consortium announced that the powers of the XHTML2 working group expire at the end of 2009. Thus, all further development of the XHTML 2.0 standard has been suspended.</p>

      <article><p>
In the mid-1990s, the major browser vendors - Netscape and Microsoft - began to implement their own sets of elements in HTML markup. There was a confusion of various designs for working on the World Wide Web, available for viewing in one or another browser. Especially great difficulties were when creating cross-browser programs in the JavaScript language. Webmasters had to create several variants of pages or resort to other tricks. For a while, the problem has lost relevance for two reasons:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
Because of the Internet browser's replacement of all other browsers. Accordingly, the problem of webmasters became a problem for users of alternative browsers.</li>
          <li>
Thanks to the efforts of manufacturers of other browsers that either followed the W3C standards (like Mozilla and Opera), or tried to create maximum compatibility with Internet Explorer.</li>
          </ul>
            <p>
At the present stage, we can state the popularity of browsers following the recommendations of W3C (this is Mozilla Firefox and other browsers on the Gecko engine, Safari, Google Chrome, Opera and other browsers on the WebKit engine). The share of Internet Explorer in January 2016 is less than 15%
        </p>
        <p>
In modern practice, there is an opportunity to simplify the development of cross-browser programs in the language of JavaScript using various libraries and frameworks. For example, such as jQuery, sIFR, and others.

        <header> Cascading Style Sheets</header> 
      <article><p>
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.</p>

<p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.</p>

<p>
Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.</p>

<p>The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.</p>
<p>The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.</p>
        <p>In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS, including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Syntax">
        <header>Syntax</header> 
      <article><p>
CSS has a simple syntax and uses a number of English keywords to specify the names of various style properties.</p>

<p>A style sheet consists of a list of rules. Each rule or rule-set consists of one or more selectors, and a declaration block.</p>
          </article>          
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Selector">
        <header>Selector</header> 
      <article><p>
In CSS, selectors declare which part of the markup a style applies to by matching tags and attributes in the markup itself.

Selectors may apply to:</p>

          <ul>
            <li> all elements of a specific type, e.g. the second-level headers h2</li>
            <li> elements specified by attribute, in particular:</li><ul><li>id: an identifier unique within the document</li>
            <li>class: an identifier that can annotate multiple elements in a document<\li></ul>
              <li>elements depending on how they are placed relative to others in the document tree.<\li>

            </ul>
                <p> Classes and IDs are case-sensitive, start with letters, and can include alphanumeric characters and underscores. A class may apply to any number of instances of any elements. An ID may only be applied to a single element.

Pseudo-classes are used in CSS selectors to permit formatting based on information that is not contained in the document tree. One example of a widely used pseudo-class is :hover, which identifies content only when the user “points to” the visible element, usually by holding the mouse cursor over it. It is appended to a selector as in a:hover or #elementid:hover. A pseudo-class classifies document elements, such as :link or :visited, whereas a pseudo-element makes a selection that may consist of partial elements, such as ::first-line or ::first-letter.</p>
                <p> Selectors may be combined in many ways to achieve great specificity and flexibility.[7] Multiple selectors may be joined in a spaced list to specify elements by location, element type, id, class, or any combination thereof. The order of the selectors is important. For example, div .myClass {color: red;} applies to all elements of class myClass that are inside div elements, whereas .myClass div {color: red;} applies to all div elements that are in elements of class myClass.

The following table provides a summary of selector syntax indicating usage and the version of CSS that introduced it.</p>

CSS was first proposed by Håkon Wium Lie on October 10, 1994.[19] At the time, Lie was working with Tim Berners-Lee at CERN.[20] Several other style sheet languages for the web were proposed around the same time, and discussions on public mailing lists and inside World Wide Web Consortium resulted in the first W3C CSS Recommendation (CSS1)[21] being released in 1996. In particular, Bert Bos' proposal was influential; he became co-author of CSS1 and is regarded as co-creator of CSS</p>

<p>Style sheets have existed in one form or another since the beginnings of Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) in the 1980s, and CSS was developed to provide style sheets for the web.[23] One requirement for a web style sheet language was for style sheets to come from different sources on the web. Therefore, existing style sheet languages like DSSSL and FOSI were not suitable. CSS, on the other hand, let a document's style be influenced by multiple style sheets by way of "cascading" styles</p>
        <p>As HTML grew, it came to encompass a wider variety of stylistic capabilities to meet the demands of web developers. This evolution gave the designer more control over site appearance, at the cost of more complex HTML. Variations in web browser implementations, such as ViolaWWW and WorldWideWeb,[24] made consistent site appearance difficult, and users had less control over how web content was displayed. The browser/editor developed by Tim Berners-Lee had style sheets that were hard-coded into the program. The style sheets could therefore not be linked to documents on the web.[25] Robert Cailliau, also of CERN, wanted to separate the structure from the presentation so that different style sheets could describe different presentation for printing, screen-based presentations, and editors</p>
        <p>Improving web presentation capabilities was a topic of interest to many in the web community and nine different style sheet languages were proposed on the www-style mailing list.[23] Of these nine proposals, two were especially influential on what became CSS: Cascading HTML Style Sheets[19] and Stream-based Style Sheet Proposal (SSP).[22][26] Two browsers served as testbeds for the initial proposals; Lie worked with Yves Lafon to implement CSS in Dave Raggett's Arena browser.[27][28][29] Bert Bos implemented his own SSP proposal in the Argo browser.[22] Thereafter, Lie and Bos worked together to develop the CSS standard (the 'H' was removed from the name because these style sheets could also be applied to other markup languages besides HTML).</p>
        <p>Lie's proposal was presented at the "Mosaic and the Web" conference (later called WWW2) in Chicago, Illinois in 1994, and again with Bert Bos in 1995.[20] Around this time the W3C was already being established, and took an interest in the development of CSS. It organized a workshop toward that end chaired by Steven Pemberton. This resulted in W3C adding work on CSS to the deliverables of the HTML editorial review board (ERB). Lie and Bos were the primary technical staff on this aspect of the project, with additional members, including Thomas Reardon of Microsoft, participating as well. In August 1996 Netscape Communication Corporation presented an alternative style sheet language called JavaScript Style Sheets (JSSS).[20] The spec was never finished and is deprecated.[30] By the end of 1996, CSS was ready to become official, and the CSS level 1 Recommendation was published in December.</p>
        <p>Development of HTML, CSS, and the DOM had all been taking place in one group, the HTML Editorial Review Board (ERB). Early in 1997, the ERB was split into three working groups: HTML Working group, chaired by Dan Connolly of W3C; DOM Working group, chaired by Lauren Wood of SoftQuad; and CSS Working group, chaired by Chris Lilley of W3C.</p>
        
        <p>The CSS Working Group began tackling issues that had not been addressed with CSS level 1, resulting in the creation of CSS level 2 on November 4, 1997. It was published as a W3C Recommendation on May 12, 1998. CSS level 3, which was started in 1998, is still under development as of 2014.</p>
        <p>In 2005 the CSS Working Groups decided to enforce the requirements for standards more strictly. This meant that already published standards like CSS 2.1, CSS 3 Selectors and CSS 3 Text were pulled back from Candidate Recommendation to Working Draft level.</p>

        <header>Difficulty with adoption</header> 
      <article><p>
The CSS 1 specification was completed in 1996. Microsoft's Internet Explorer 3[20] was released in that year, featuring some limited support for CSS. IE 4 and Netscape 4.x added more support, but it was typically incomplete and had many bugs that prevented CSS from being usefully adopted. It was more than three years before any web browser achieved near-full implementation of the specification. Internet Explorer 5.0 for the Macintosh, shipped in March 2000, was the first browser to have full (better than 99 percent) CSS 1 support,[31] surpassing Opera, which had been the leader since its introduction of CSS support 15 months earlier. Other browsers followed soon afterwards, and many of them additionally implemented parts of CSS 2.</p>
        <p>However, even when later ‘version 5’ web browsers began to offer a fairly full implementation of CSS, they were still incorrect in certain areas and were fraught with inconsistencies, bugs and other quirks. Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.x for Windows, as opposed to the very different IE for Macintosh, had a seriously incorrect implementation of the ‘CSS box model’, as compared with the CSS standards. This is a set of rules that specify certain aspects of the sizing and layout of components of a web page. Such inconsistencies and variation in feature support made it difficult for designers to achieve a consistent appearance across browsers and platforms without the use of workarounds termed CSS hacks and filters. The IE/Windows box model bugs were so serious that, when Internet Explorer 6 was released, Microsoft introduced a backwards-compatible mode of CSS interpretation (‘quirks mode’) plus an alternative, corrected 'standards mode'. Other non-Microsoft browsers also provided this very same ‘mode’-switch behavior capability. Unfortunately, ever since the release of IE 6 in 2001, it has become necessary for the authors of webpages’ html files to make sure that the html contains a special distinctive ‘standards-compliant CSS intended’ marker to show that the authors intend CSS to be interpreted correctly, in compliance with standards, as opposed to being intended for the now long-obsolete IE5/Windows browser. Without this marker, web browsers that have the ‘quirks mode’-switching capability will size objects in web pages as IE5/Windows would rather than following CSS standards.</p>
        <p>Problems with browsers' patchy adoption of CSS, along with errata in the original specification, led the W3C to revise the CSS 2 standard into CSS 2.1, which moved nearer to a working snapshot of current CSS support in HTML browsers. Some CSS 2 properties that no browser successfully implemented were dropped, and in a few cases, defined behaviors were changed to bring the standard into line with the predominant existing implementations. CSS 2.1 became a Candidate Recommendation on February 25, 2004, but CSS 2.1 was pulled back to Working Draft status on June 13, 2005,[32] and only returned to Candidate Recommendation status on July 19, 2007.[33]</p>
        <p>In addition to these problems, the .css extension was used by a software product used to convert PowerPoint files into Compact Slide Show files,[34] so some web servers served all .css[35] as mime type application/x-pointplus[36] rather than text/css.</p>

CSS has various levels and profiles. Each level of CSS builds upon the last, typically adding new features and typically denoted as CSS 1, CSS 2, CSS 3, and CSS 4. Profiles are typically a subset of one or more levels of CSS built for a particular device or user interface. Currently there are profiles for mobile devices, printers, and television sets. Profiles should not be confused with media types, which were added in CSS 2.</p>

      <article><p>
Each web browser uses a layout engine to render web pages, and support for CSS functionality is not consistent between them. Because browsers do not parse CSS perfectly, multiple coding techniques have been developed to target specific browsers with workarounds (commonly known as CSS hacks or CSS filters). Adoption of new functionality in CSS can be hindered by lack of support in major browsers. For example, Internet Explorer was slow to add support for many CSS 3 features, which slowed adoption of those features and damaged the browser's reputation among developers.[59] In order to ensure a consistent experience for their users, web developers often test their sites across multiple operating systems, browsers, and browser versions, increasing development time and complexity. Tools such as BrowserStack have been built to reduce the complexity of maintaining these environments.</p>
        
        <p>
In addition to these testing tools, many sites maintain lists of browser support for specific CSS properties, including CanIUse and the Mozilla Developer Network. Additionally, the CSS 3 defines feature queries, which provide an @supports directive that will allow developers to target browsers with support for certain functionality directly within their CSS.[60] CSS that is not supported by older browsers can also sometimes be patched in using Javascript polyfills, which are pieces of Javascript code designed to make browsers behave consistently. These workarounds—and the need to support fallback functionality—can add complexity to development projects, and consequently, companies frequently define a list of browser versions that they will and will not support.</p>
        <p>
As websites adopt newer code standards that are incompatible with older browsers, these browsers can be cut off from accessing many of the resources on the web (sometimes intentionally).[61] Many of the most popular sites on the internet are not just visually degraded on older browsers due to poor CSS support, but do not work at all, in large part due to the evolution of Javascript and other web technologies.</p>

         <section class="main-section" id="Limitations">
        <header>Limitations</header> 
      <article><p>
<p>Some noted limitations of the current capabilities of CSS include:</p>

        <h3>Selectors are unable to ascend</h3>
<p>CSS currently offers no way to select a parent or ancestor of an element that satisfies certain criteria. CSS Selectors Level 4, which is still in Working Draft status, proposes such a selector, but only as part of the "complete" selector profile, not the "fast" profile used in dynamic CSS styling. A more advanced selector scheme (such as XPath) would enable more sophisticated style sheets. The major reasons for the CSS Working Group previously rejecting proposals for parent selectors are related to browser performance and incremental rendering issues.</p>
        <h3>Cannot explicitly declare new scope independently of position</h3>
<p>Scoping rules for properties such as z-index look for the closest parent element with a position:absolute or position:relative attribute. This odd coupling has undesired effects. For example, it is impossible to avoid declaring a new scope when one is forced to adjust an element's position, preventing one from using the desired scope of a parent element.</p>
        <h3>Pseudo-class dynamic behavior not controllable</h3>
<p>CSS implements pseudo-classes that allow a degree of user feedback by conditional application of alternate styles. One CSS pseudo-class, ":hover", is dynamic (equivalent of JavaScript "onmouseover") and has potential for abuse (e.g., implementing cursor-proximity popups),[66] but CSS has no ability for a client to disable it (no "disable"-like property) or limit its effects (no "nochange"-like values for each property).</p>
        <h3>Cannot name rules</h3>
<p>There is no way to name a CSS rule, which would allow (for example) client-side scripts to refer to the rule even if its selector changes.</p>
        <h3>Cannot include styles from a rule into another rule</h3>
<p>CSS styles often must be duplicated in several rules to achieve a desired effect, causing additional maintenance and requiring more thorough testing. Some new CSS features were proposed to solve this, but (as of February, 2016) are not yet implemented anywhere.
Cannot target specific text without altering markup
Besides the :first-letter pseudo-element, one cannot target specific ranges of text without needing to utilize place-holder elements.</p>

        <header>Advantages</header> 
      <article><p>


        <h3>Separation of content from presentation</h3>
<p>CSS facilitates publication of content in multiple presentation formats based on nominal parameters. Nominal parameters include explicit user preferences, different web browsers, the type of device being used to view the content (a desktop computer or mobile Internet device), the geographic location of the user and many other variables.</p>
        <h3>Site-wide consistency</h3>
<p>When CSS is used effectively, in terms of inheritance and "cascading", a global style sheet can be used to affect and style elements site-wide. If the situation arises that the styling of the elements should be changed or adjusted, these changes can be made by editing rules in the global style sheet. Before CSS, this sort of maintenance was more difficult, expensive and time-consuming.</p>
        <h3>Bandwidth</h3>
<p>A stylesheet, internal or external, specifies the style once for a range of HTML elements selected by class, type or relationship to others. This is much more efficient than repeating style information inline for each occurrence of the element. An external stylesheet is usually stored in the browser cache, and can therefore be used on multiple pages without being reloaded, further reducing data transfer over a network.</p>
        <h3>Page reformatting</h3>
<p>With a simple change of one line, a different style sheet can be used for the same page. This has advantages for accessibility, as well as providing the ability to tailor a page or site to different target devices. Furthermore, devices not able to understand the styling still display the content.</p>
        <h3>Accessibility</h3>
<p>Without CSS, web designers must typically lay out their pages with techniques such as HTML tables that hinder accessibility for vision-impaired users (see Tableless web design#Accessibility).</p>
